# Working with Refs and Portals

This project is from a Udemy course on React.

It creates a simple web app that has four Timer games where the objective is to start the timer and then try and stop the timer close to the target time listed.

Each game opens its own modal to display the results.

## Concepts Applied

### Acessing DOM Elements w/ Refs

- React hook - `useRef()` hook

### Managing values w/ Refs

- React hook - `forwardRef()` hook

### Exposing API functions from Components

- React hook - `useImperativeHandle()`

### Detaching DOM rendering from JSX w/ Portals

- ReactDOM hook - `createPortal()`
